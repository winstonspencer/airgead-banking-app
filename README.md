# Summary

This application will determine how investments will grow over time.   It calculates the power of compound interest based on the users inputs.  The user will  input the following:
 
 - An initial deposit amount
 - A monthly deposit amount
 - The interest rate
 - The investment time in years.

The application then calculate the compounded interest and total balance over time.

## Maintainability & Support
The application consists of several independent modules that promotes maintainability and support.  The Menu, Table and InvesmentData classes were carefully coded and commented to be readable and reusable.   There is also a design diagram and pseudo code that can be used to help explain how the application works.
